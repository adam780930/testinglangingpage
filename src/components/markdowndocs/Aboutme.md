I am a passionate, highly motivated and self-driven Full-Stack software engineer living in California. My primary dev stack are: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, HTML, CSS, Rest API, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL.

I completed the engineering course with [Chegg Skills](https://www.chegg.com/skills/)(formerly known as Thinkful) in 2023 and briefly worked as a JavaScript Software Developer(contracted position) at [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com/) for the development of internal tools.

I am dedicated to continuous learning and improvement in the field of web development. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow.
